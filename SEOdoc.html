        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of enhancing a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). The primary goal of SEO is to attract organic (non-paid) traffic by ensuring that a site ranks higher for relevant keywords. Effective SEO involves a combination of technical, on-page, and off-page strategies.</p>

        <h2>Meta Tags in SEO</h2>
        <p>Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content. They are not visible on the page itself but are found in the HTML code. The most important meta tags include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title Tag:</strong> This tag defines the title of the webpage and is crucial for SEO. It appears in search results as the clickable headline.</li>
            <li><strong>Meta Description:</strong> This tag provides a brief summary of the page's content. While it does not directly influence rankings, a well-crafted description can improve click-through rates (CTR).</li>
            <li><strong>Viewport Meta Tag:</strong> Essential for responsive design, this tag ensures that a webpage is displayed correctly on different devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Robots Meta Tag:</strong> This tag instructs search engines on how to index the page and whether to follow links on it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
        <p>Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the web content, helping search engines understand the context of the information. Key semantic elements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code>: Defines the header of a page or section, typically containing the title and navigation links.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code>: Groups related content together, making it easier for search engines to understand the structure of the page.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: Contains information about the author, copyright, and links to related content.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars.</li>
        </ul>
